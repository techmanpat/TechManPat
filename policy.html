            This page explains exactly how TechManPat handles reviews, sponsored content, and affiliate links.  
            Transparency and viewer trust come first, always.

        <h2>Our Commitment</h2>
        <p>
          TechManPat is built on honesty, independence, and real-world testing.  
          This policy exists to make our standards clear to viewers, brands, and agencies.
        </p>
        <p>
          We do not blur the line between reviews and advertising.  
          We do not trade opinions for money.  
          And we do not compromise editorial control.
        </p>

        <h2>Agreement to This Policy</h2>
        <p>
          By sending products to TechManPat or engaging us for any form of content, you agree to this policy in full.
          These terms are non-negotiable.
        </p>
        <p>
          If these conditions do not align with your expectations, please do not send products or request coverage.
        </p>

        <h2>Product Reviews (Unpaid)</h2>
        <p>
          Product reviews on TechManPat are always unpaid and independent.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>No payment.</strong> Reviews labeled as “Product Review” are never sponsored.</li>
          <li><strong>No editorial influence.</strong> Brands do not approve scripts, opinions, or final cuts.</li>
          <li><strong>No softening.</strong> Issues, bugs, and shortcomings are openly discussed.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          If a product improves after review (for example via firmware updates), we may acknowledge that in follow-up
          content. Our goal is accuracy over time, not one-off impressions.
        </p>

        <p>
          Our audience comes first. If a product underperforms, viewers will hear about it.
        </p>

        <h2>Editorial Videos (Sponsored Content)</h2>
        <p>
          Editorial videos are sponsored overviews, not reviews.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Clearly disclosed.</strong> Sponsored content is always labeled and compliant with platform rules.</li>
          <li><strong>No review score.</strong> Editorials showcase features and usage, not verdicts.</li>
          <li><strong>Editorial control retained.</strong> TechManPat controls the narrative and final edit.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Sponsors may be informed of issues prior to release, but sponsorship does not prevent honest discussion.
          If something materially affects the user experience, it will be mentioned.
        </p>

        <p>
          We only accept sponsorships that align with our content and audience.  
          Viewer trust always outweighs commercial opportunity.
        </p>

        <h2>Affiliate Disclosure</h2>
        <p>
          TechManPat uses affiliate links to help support the channel.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Affiliate links may appear in video descriptions or on this website.</li>
          <li>Most links are Amazon Australia affiliates, with occasional brand-specific links.</li>
          <li>Using these links does not increase the price you pay.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Affiliate commissions help cover production costs such as equipment, software, and time.
          They do not influence coverage, opinions, or conclusions.
        </p>

        <p>
          Affiliate links are always disclosed clearly in accordance with platform and regulatory guidelines.
        </p>

        <h2>In Short</h2>
        <p>
          TechManPat exists to serve viewers, not brands.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Reviews are unpaid and independent</li>
          <li>Sponsored content is clearly labeled</li>
          <li>Affiliate links do not affect opinions</li>
          <li>Editorial control always stays with TechManPat</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          This policy is our badge of honour and the foundation of trust with our audience.
